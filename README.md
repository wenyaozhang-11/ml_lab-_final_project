USF MSDS Machine Learning Lab Course Final Project

This project aims to predict whether or not a Pokemon is a legendary?

Why it is important?
If we find out what consitutes a Pokemon to be legendary, it will be a guideline to catch a legendary Pokomen that can large improve users' experience.

What I find?
1.The attributes that reflect pokemon’s qualities of ‘rare and powerful’ work well on predicting what is a legendary Pokemon.
2.Random Forest works best to classify the legendary Pokemon and normal Pokemon.
